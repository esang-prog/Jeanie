‎        <h1>FAMILY BACKGROUND</h1>
‎        <p>I come from a large family of eight siblings. Our parents have been very supportive, and I'm the fourth child. My oldest brother is already married, but he still lives with our parents along with his wife. This arrangement doesn't bother our parents, as he is still their child.Among my siblings, I have five brothers and three sisters, making a total of eight of us. In our family, three of us are in college, one is in senior high school, one is in high school, and one is still in elementary school. My youngest brother is only three years old and hasn't started school yet.
‎My father works in construction, while my mother sells snacks on the street with the help of my brother's wife. They walk around, shouting out the names of the snacks they're selling. My oldest brother works in the water market, delivering bottled water.
‎My older sister is currently a graduating student, pursuing a Bachelor of Elementary Education. Next year, I'll be graduating with my Associate's degree in Computer Technology.</p>
